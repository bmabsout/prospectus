= Proposed Methodology

Our proposed work focuses on three key areas that will advance the field of Expressive Reinforcement Learning:

== Structured Objective Specification (AQS)
=== Preliminary Results
- Novel domain-specific language design
- Power-mean operators and Q-value normalization
- 600% improvement in sample efficiency
=== Future Development
- Formal semantics and verification
- Safety constraint integration
- Theoretical guarantees

== Intention-Preserving Transfer (Anchor Critics)
=== Preliminary Results
- Multi-objective Q-value optimization
- Preventing catastrophic forgetting
- Systems Implementation
  - SWANNFlight firmware development
  - On-board inference optimization
=== Future Development
- System identification integration
- Real-time adaptation strategies
- Hardware-in-the-loop validation

== Objective Composition and Validation
=== Theoretical Integration
- Unifying Q-value based objectives
  - Compositional properties
  - Theoretical guarantees
=== Validation Methods
- Behavioral verification metrics
  - Trade-off preservation analysis
  - Compositional property validation

This methodology builds on our preliminary results while advancing both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of expressive reinforcement learning.
