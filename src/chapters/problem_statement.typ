= Problem Statement and Objectives

The fundamental challenge in robot learning lies in bridging the intent-to-reality gapâ€”the disparity between a practitioner's intended robot behavior and what is achieved in reality. While reinforcement learning offers powerful tools for developing complex controllers, three critical limitations prevent its widespread adoption in real-world robotics:

First, practitioners struggle to translate their high-level intentions into precise learning objectives. Current approaches rely on brittle linear reward composition and manual tuning, making it difficult to express and balance multiple competing objectives. This intent-to-behavior gap leads to policies that either fail to learn desired behaviors or require prohibitive engineering effort to achieve them.

Second, even when policies perform well in simulation, they often fail to preserve learned behaviors when deployed to real systems. Traditional approaches to sim-to-real transfer treat it as a domain adaptation problem, leading to catastrophic forgetting where policies maintain performance on common scenarios but fail in critical edge cases. This challenge is particularly acute in robotics, where failures in rare but important scenarios can lead to system damage or safety violations.

Third, the computational and energy demands of learned policies often make deployment impractical on real robotic systems. Current methods produce controllers with excessive oscillations that waste energy and stress hardware, while standard neural architectures are unnecessarily complex for deployment. These efficiency challenges compound when attempting to deploy multiple policies or adapt to changing conditions.

We argue that addressing these challenges requires fundamentally rethinking how practitioners express and compose their intentions throughout the learning process. Instead of focusing solely on optimization algorithms, we must develop principled frameworks for:
1. Specifying behavioral objectives in ways that capture intended relationships and trade-offs
2. Preserving learned behaviors during transfer while enabling controlled adaptation
3. Ensuring efficient deployment through resource-aware policy design

Our research addresses these challenges through four interconnected objectives:

1. *Structured Objective Specification:* Develop a principled framework for composing behavioral objectives that enables practitioners to directly express intended relationships and trade-offs. This includes both the mathematical foundations for combining objectives and practical tools for specifying complex behaviors.

2. *Intention-Preserving Transfer:* Create methods that maintain critical behaviors during sim-to-real transfer by treating adaptation as multi-objective optimization over Q-values from both domains. This ensures policies can adapt to reality while preserving behaviors learned in simulation.

3. *Resource-Aware Control:* Design techniques for learning controllers that are efficient in both computation and energy usage. This spans from action smoothness for energy efficiency to architectural optimization for reduced inference cost.

4. *Practical Validation:* Demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches through systematic evaluation on increasingly complex robotic systems, from quadrotor attitude control to multi-agent scenarios. This includes developing open-source tools and frameworks to enable broader adoption.

Through these objectives, we aim to transform how practitioners develop robotic systems by providing principled ways to express intentions, preserve behaviors, and ensure efficient deployment. The following sections detail our progress toward these goals and outline the remaining work needed to complete this vision.
