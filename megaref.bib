The training is performed in a simulated environment in which we randomize many of the physical properties of the system such as friction coefficients and an object’s appearance. Our policies transfer to the physical robot despite being trained entirely in simulation. Our method does not rely on any human demonstrations, but many behaviors found in human manipulation emerge naturally, including finger gaiting, multi-finger coordination, and the controlled use of gravity. Our results were obtained using the same distributed RL system that was used to train OpenAI Five. We also include a video of our results: https://youtu.be/jwSbzNHGflM.}

	abstract     = {<p>In embodied computation (or morphological computation), part of the complexity of motor control is offloaded to the body dynamics. We demonstrate that a simple Hebbian-like learning rule can be used to train systems with (partial) embodiment, and can be extended outside of the scope of traditional neural networks. To this end, we apply the learning rule to optimize the connection weights of recurrent neural networks with different topologies and for various tasks. We then apply this learning rule to a simulated compliant tensegrity robot by optimizing static feedback controllers that directly exploit the dynamics of the robot body. This leads to partially embodied controllers, i.e., hybrid controllers that naturally integrate the computations that are performed by the robot body into a neural network architecture. Our results demonstrate the universal applicability of reward-modulated Hebbian learning. Furthermore, they demonstrate the robustness of systems trained with the learning rule. This study strengthens our belief that compliant robots should or can be seen as computational units, instead of dumb hardware that needs a complex controller. This link between compliant robotics and neural networks is also the main reason for our search for simple universal learning rules for both neural networks and robotics.</p>}

	abstract     = {<p>It is well-known that human social interactions generate synchrony phenomena which are often unconscious. If the interaction between individuals is based on rhythmic movements, synchronized and coordinated movements will emerge from the social synchrony. This paper proposes a plausible model of plastic neural controllers that allows the emergence of synchronized movements in physical and rhythmical interactions. The controller is designed with central pattern generators (CPG) based on rhythmic Rowat-Selverston neurons endowed with neuronal and synaptic Hebbian plasticity. To demonstrate the interest of the proposed model, the case of handshaking is considered because it is a very common, both physically and socially, but also, a very complex act in the point of view of robotics, neuroscience and psychology. Plastic CPGs controllers are implemented in the joints of a simulated robotic arm that has to learn the frequency and amplitude of an external force applied to its effector, thus reproducing the act of handshaking with a human. Results show that the neural and synaptic Hebbian plasticity are working together leading to a natural and autonomous synchronization between the arm and the external force even if the frequency is changing during the movement. Moreover, a power consumption analysis shows that, by offering emergence of synchronized and coordinated movements, the plasticity mechanisms lead to a significant decrease in the energy spend by the robot actuators thus generating a more adaptive and natural human/robot handshake.</p>}

	abstract     = {Lifelong learning and adaptability are two defining aspects of biological agents. Modern reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown significant progress in solving complex tasks, however once training is concluded, the found solutions are typically static and incapable of adapting to new information or perturbations. While it is still not completely understood how biological brains learn and adapt so efficiently from experience, it is believed that synaptic plasticity plays a prominent role in this process. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose a search method that, instead of optimizing the weight parameters of neural networks directly, only searches for synapse-specific Hebbian learning rules that allow the network to continuously self-organize its weights during the lifetime of the agent. We demonstrate our approach on several reinforcement learning tasks with different sensory modalities and more than 450K trainable plasticity parameters. We find that starting from completely random weights, the discovered Hebbian rules enable an agent to navigate a dynamical 2D-pixel environment; likewise they allow a simulated 3D quadrupedal robot to learn how to walk while adapting to morphological damage not seen during training and in the absence of any explicit reward or error signal in less than 100 timesteps.},

	abstract     = {We focus on the problem of reliably training Reinforcement Learning (RL) models (agents) for stable low-level control in embedded systems and test our methods on a high-performance, custom-built quadrotor platform. A common but often under-studied problem in developing RL agents for continuous control is that the control policies developed are not always smooth. This lack of smoothness can be a major problem when learning controllers as it can result in control instability and hardware failure.Issues of noisy control are further accentuated when training RL agents in simulation due to simulators ultimately being imperfect representations of reality—what is known as the reality gap. To combat issues of instability in RL agents, we propose a systematic framework, REinforcement-based transferable Agents through Learning (RE+AL), for designing simulated training environments that preserve the quality of trained agents when transferred to real platforms. RE+AL is an evolution of the Neuroflight infrastructure detailed in technical reports prepared by members of our research group. Neuroflight is a state-of-the-art framework for training RL agents for low-level attitude control. RE+AL improves and completes Neuroflight by solving a number of important limitations that hindered the deployment of Neuroflight to real hardware. We benchmark RE+AL on the NF1 racing quadrotor developed as part of Neuroflight. We demonstrate that RE+AL significantly mitigates the previously observed issues of smoothness in RL agents. Additionally, RE+AL is shown to consistently train agents that are flight capable and with minimal degradation in controller quality upon transfer. RE+AL agents also learn to perform better than a tuned PID controller, with better tracking errors, smoother control, and reduced power consumption. To the best of our knowledge, RE+AL agents are the first RL-based controllers trained in simulation to outperform a well-tuned PID controller on a real-world controls problem that is solvable with classical control.},

	abstract     = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated to be useful for a wide variety of robotics applications. To address sample efficiency and safety during training, it is common to train Deep RL policies in a simulator and then deploy to the real world, a process called Sim2Real transfer.  For robotics applications, the deployment heterogeneities and runtime compute stochasticity results in variable timing characteristics of sensor sampling rates and end-to-end delays from sensing to actuation. Prior works have used the technique of domain randomization to enable the successful transfer of policies across domains having different state transition delays. We show that variation in sampling rates and policy execution time leads to degradation in Deep RL policy performance, and that domain randomization is insufficient to overcome this limitation. We propose the Time-in-State RL (TSRL) approach, which includes delays and sampling rate as additional agent observations at training time to improve the robustness of Deep RL policies. We demonstrate the efficacy of TSRL on HalfCheetah, Ant, and car robot in simulation and on a real robot using a 1/18th scale car.}

abstract = {We propose new methods for learning control policies and neural network Lyapunov functions for nonlinear control problems, with provable guarantee of stability. The framework consists of a learner that attempts to find the control and Lyapunov functions, and a falsifier that finds counterexamples to quickly guide the learner towards solutions. The procedure terminates when no counterexample is found by the falsifier, in which case the controlled nonlinear system is provably stable. The approach significantly simplifies the process of Lyapunov control design, provides end-to-end correctness guarantee, and can obtain much larger regions of attraction than existing methods such as LQR and SOS/SDP. We show experiments on how the new methods obtain high-quality solutions for challenging robot control problems such as path tracking for wheeled vehicles and humanoid robot balancing.},

By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified scheme, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is effective for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters.}

Corresponding units are proposed for a classification of industrial processes in terms of the two principal characteristics affecting their controllability. Formulas are given which enable the controller settings to be determined from the experimental or calculated values of the lag and unit reaction rate of the process to be controlled. These units form the basis of a quick method for adjusting a controller on the job. The effect of varying each controller setting is shown in a series of chart records. It is believed that the conceptions of control presented in this paper will be of assistance in the adjustment of existing controller applications and in the design of new installations.}}
